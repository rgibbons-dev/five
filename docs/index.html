  <h1>On `five`</h1>
  <p>
    Smartphone and social media addiction is an issue I've been dealing with. In an effort to combat this, I sought out to forcibly restrain myself 
    from accessing these apps and websites, first using the built-in App Limits feature on my iPhone, then turning to stronger third-party apps that, 
    instead of simply telling you that your time is up, they make you wait for a certain amount of time, say ten seconds, before you can use the app, 
    giving you time to make a conscious choice as to whether it is absolutely necessary to use the app at that moment. It also happens to be the case 
    that this is a lucrative industry, with seemingly every app locking full functionality behind a subscription paywall, just another brick in this 
    (very silly) Productivity Industrial Complex. There is a spectre haunting the Unitied States, the spectre of Productivity. I digress. I sought to 
    create an alternative to these apps, one that is wholly free to use. I failed; I did not know beforehand that Apple softly forbids apps from doing 
    something that would serve as the load-bearing beam of this app: opening other apps. On iOS, apps are opened via URL schemes, but outside of a few 
    exceptions carved out for developers, only Apple is allowed to produce apps that can open other apps.
  </p>
  <p>
    Despite this, I still made a working version of the app. It is minimal; it leans heavily on Shortcuts and Personal Automations to trigger the app 
    lockout. The workflow is as follows: the user creates a Personal Automation that is to be triggered on opening of their desired app, then adds the 
    "take five" Shortcut to this automation and selects the corresponding app from the dropdown. That's it. It's hardwired to a certain period of time, 
    but I implemented a user interface in the Android version, <a href="https://github.com/rgibbons-dev/anfive">anfive</a> that allows the user to change 
    how long they want to wait before the app is to open. One limitation that I ran into with this dropdown is that it was a compromised solution; I preferred 
    to infer the app from the automation, but I wasn't able to figure out how to get that working. Anyway, this is all to say that this is an incomplete, 
    archived project; in order for it to be submitted to the App Store, I'd have to obfusucate the code that does the app opening, which is not a guaranteed 
    recipe for success, as I'm sure that Apple may have looked the other way for the other apps that do this because they're making money off of them, while 
    'five' is meant to be totally free, thus bound to be more closely scrutinized. Should third-party app stores be a success and not gimped by Apple, I'll 
    publish this app there, but until then, it will remain here, in the archives.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, before I take five, I'd like to share my report on the process of developing this app. I started with ChatGPT (GPT-4). I was curious to see if it would 
    live up to the hype. It didn't. I ended up trawling GitHub repositories, stackoverflow, and blog posts for insight into how to do what I wanted to do in 
    SwiftUI, something totally new to me. I found SwiftUI enjoyable and straightforward to use. I planned for two central views: a landing page, and a page 
    that was to render when the Shortcut was triggered. The latter involved a progress bar represented as a circle. It was a bit tricky to get it working as intended; 
    I needed to use two timers, one for the countdown and one for the progress bar. I tried to use only one, but it required complex logic, so I settled on having 
    two independent timers. Next I had to ensure that a button was rendered, this button would take the user to their desired app. Creating a button is clearly trivial, 
    doing it while making sure that it appeared upon progress bar completion and in the right position was not. I wanted it to be centered in the middle of the progress 
    bar, but I ended up settling on having it appear below, using a VStack. I used the opacity property and a boolean variable associated with completion of the 
    progress bar to achieve the visibility effect. Using opacity makes the button take up space ahead of time, instead of being rendered conditionally.

    With the Views complete, the second half of the app involved dealing with AppIntents. The WWDC22 session, “Dive into App Intents”, guided me through the process 
    of creating a Shortcut. Using this, some stackoverflow posts, and the documentation, I created a Shortcut. To glue it all together required a ViewModel, which on 
    performance of the Shortcut, handled navigation from the app to `five`, and after completion of the timer, handled navigation back to the app on the button click. 
    That's about it. Like I said, very simple app. Below are the resources I used in the making of this app.
